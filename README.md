# yt-dlp-generator
**generates ytdlp commands in chrome browser**

Download the yt-dlp-generator folder and enable developer mode in chrome and import the folder and Enjoy

***
you can create your own yt-dlp chrome extension with **AI gemini 2.5 pro** i have given my prompt in file [**gemini 2.5 pro yt-dlp prompt**](https://github.com/xdev23/yt-dlp-generator/blob/main/gemini%202.5%20pro%20yt-dlp%20prompt)  paste the prompt in gemini 2.5 pro in https://aistudio.google.com then you will have a extension like mine

**pls check the prompt- i am not responsible for any issue**

i didnt want to download 3rd party gui apps bcoz they consume RAM, behind the scene using yt-dlp so i just created chrome extension then works the same way,now i just have to copy then command and paste.

my extension doesnt detect m3u8 or hls streams bcoz i dont know how to code, this script is good for youtube and embeded urls thats it, but i think if m3u8 detecter extensions integrate yt-dlp that would replace downloader managers like idm or video download helper, these extensions do same thing but with less 2-3 mouse clicks.

# yt-dlp-generator
**generates ytdlp commands in chrome browser**

Download the yt-dlp-generator folder and enable developer mode in chrome and import the folder and Enjoy

With this you don't need to copy video link and write manual yt-dlp command, this is for quick commands and time saving, thats it.

***
you can create your own yt-dlp chrome extension with **AI gemini 2.5 pro** i have given my prompt in file [**gemini 2.5 pro yt-dlp prompt**](https://github.com/xdev23/yt-dlp-generator/blob/main/gemini%202.5%20pro%20yt-dlp%20prompt)  paste the prompt in gemini 2.5 pro in https://aistudio.google.com then you will have a extension like mine

**pls check the prompt- i am not responsible for any issue**

i didnt want to download 3rd party gui apps bcoz they consume RAM, behind the scene using yt-dlp so i just created chrome extension that works the same way as those gui apps, Now the only thing I need to do is copy the command and paste it in terminal so yt-dlp can download, **if you have knowledge you setup a python listening server and extension will send the command automatically after that, this way it will work like a download manager.**

my extension doesnt detect m3u8 or hls streams bcoz i dont know how to code, this script is good for youtube and embeded urls thats it, but i think if m3u8 detecter extensions like [fetchV](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/fetchv-video-downloader-f/nfmmmhanepmpifddlkkmihkalkoekpfd) integrate yt-dlp command extension that can replace video downloader managers like idm or video download helper, these download manager extensions do same thing but with less 2-3 mouse clicks.
